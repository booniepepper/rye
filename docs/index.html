  <h1>ðŸŒ¾ Rye language</h1>
  
  <p>Rye is a <b>work in progress</b> programming language based on ideas from Rebol, with some aspirations from Factor and Linux shell.</p>

  <p>Rye is a high level, homoiconic, dynamic language. Currently implemented as an interpreter in Go. It's basic elements are determined, but many are still in test and design stage.</p>  

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-rye"><code language="lang-rye">
      hello: fn { a } { "Hello" +_ a + "!" }
      print hello "world"
      // outputs: Hello world!
  </code></pre>

  <p>Rye is basically a data description language (think JSON) with over 30 data types and multiple dialects (interpreters) over that data (think executable JSON).</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-rye"><code language="lang-rye">
      data: { name "Jim" age 33 }
      code: { hello data/name }
      if true code
      // outputs: Hello Jim!
  </code></pre>

  <p>It has no keywords, no special forms, every active word in it's main dialect (print, +, if, for-each, fn, class, return) is a
    function and determined on a "library level" (you can load libraries with different ones or write your own).</p>
  
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-rye"><code language="lang-rye">
      _+\: fn { a b } { a + "\n" + b }
      hello "pipe-words" +\ "and op-words!" .capitalize |print
      // outputs: Hello pipe-words!
      //          And op-words!
  </code></pre>
  
 
  <p>That's why Rye can have many more interesting language constructs (still just functions), not just typical half dozen hadrcoded into the language. And your code can use all the mechanism the language provides.</p>
  
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-rye"><code language="lang-rye">
      for range 1 100 { :n
        cases "" {
          { n .divides 3 } { "Fizz" }
          { n .divides 5 } { + "Buzz" }
          none { n }
        } |prn
      }
      // outputs: 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 ...
  </code></pre>

  <!--pre class="prettyprint lang-rye"><code language="lang-rye">
      .range 1 21 |map-where {
        { .all-with? { .divides? 3 , .divides 5 } } { FizzBuzz }
        { .divides? 3 } { Fizz }
        { .divides? 5 } { Buzz }
      } |print
  </code></pre>

  <p>Another one is a map with condition <b>map-where</b>.</p-->

  <p>It's native functions aren't only control structures, "special forms", but can also be <b>their own interpreters</b> (dialects). One example is validate
  function and it's validation-dialect.</p>

  
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-rye"><code language="lang-rye">
      { num 100 }
      |validate {
        name: optional "joedoe" string calc { .capitalize }
        num: required integer check "too-low" { > 50 }
      } |probe
      // outputs: { name "Joedoe" num 100 }
  </code></pre>

  <p>Rye also features a version of generic functions (functions that dispatch on kind of the first argument), so words in your vocabulary can many times be
    quite short. It also has syntax types for Uri-s and emails so they don't have to be strings and can give generic words context.</p>
  
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-rye"><code language="lang-rye">
    email: jane@example.com

    get https://example.com/data.json 
      |^tidy-switch { 
          404 { send email "data is missing from site" }
          _   { send email "site is not working" }
        }
      :data
    post https://httpbin.org/post data 'json
  </code></pre>

  <h3>Not in public mode!</h3>
  
  <p>The language is still early in development. I am trying out a lot of (potentially very stupid) ideas so
    <b>no bigger publicity is desired at this stage</b>. I think that the higher the cost of being stupid (more eyes on me), less chance there is of
    creating something new.</p>
  
  <p>This page is here mostly, so it helps me think (see things through user's eyes) and communicate things on more or less individual level.</p>
  
  <p>There is a small FB group with 10 local people that you can join.</p>
